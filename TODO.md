# Workflows

  The error you're encountering is related to conflicting versions of TypeScript and its dependencies in your project, even if you are not directly using TypeScript in your project. This issue can occur due to transitive dependencies, meaning that one of the packages you are using depends on a specific version of TypeScript.
